A Next.js application helping you to track a watchlist and to find stocks which are cheap with respect to the 200 days moving average.

The application uses [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to provide different authentication methods and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to persist the data.


## 🚀 Getting started

If you want to play around with the code yourself - feel free to do so 🧑🏻‍💻. First clone the project using
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/florianbuehler/dip-finder.git
```
(or alternatively using SSH and `git@github.com:florianbuehler/dip-finder.git`) and then navigate into the root folder of the project and run
```shell script
npm install
```
to install the required packages into the `node_modules` folder.


## 🔧 Development

Start the development server with hot reload configured with
```shell script
npm run dev
```
and then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the latest changes.

To help ensuring some basic formatting and code quality standards, the project has prettier and eslint configured. That's why you can simply use
```shell script
npm run lint
```
to see if the code matches the standards and run
```shell script
npm run fix-lint
```
to let eslint fix it automatically where possible.


## 💫 Deployment

Build an optimized and production ready version of the project with
```shell script
npm run build
```
The production build is located in the *./.next* directory and can be served by running
```shell script
npm run start
```
